Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:  
It is the solution of problems and the creation of useful objects with computers. Software engineers design how the software should operate, write out the instructions for the computer to do, and make certain the operations are smooth and safe
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
 
Software engineering - process of analyzing user requirements and then designing, building, and testing software application which will satisfy those requirements - The application of engineering to software because it integrates significant mathematics, computer science and practices whose origins are in the disciplines of control theory and project management. Programming - It is mainly concerned with writing code to solve inherent problems.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): 
A structured process used by software development teams to create high-quality software Which involves few steps as requirement gathering, designing, implementing, testing, deploying and maintenance. SDLC assists in managing the development process, improve communications, and assure that the final software quality meets the maximum user requirement potential.(http://www.geeksforgeeks.org)
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Agile is a methodology for the software development process that focuses on iterative and quick cycles of work known as sprints. Every cycle provides a part of the software thus shortening the detection of problems and leading them to adapt earlier. Aggressive use of customer feedback to validate how well the software is working for its intended users creates a software product that meets user needs but can require rapid changes to scope. Gile is suitable more for the projects where there are possibilities of frequent changes in the requirements.
Waterfall is a structured approach to software development where each phase (planning,design,development,testing,deployment) is completed in order, with no overlap. each phase depends on the previous one, making it difficult to make changes once a phase is finished. It provides clear structure and thorough documentation, making it best for small well-defined projects with stable requirements.(The product manager: Hannah Clark)

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:
Agile project management is a flexible approach in software solutions where the development process consists of several designated work streams and cross-functional teams who work on different parts of the project simultaneously, adapting to changes and feedback quickly. This makes it possible for changes to be made at any point during the process, which gives teams more control over what the project looks like and ensures that they are more productive.
Method: Intensive engagement with all stakeholders
Flexibility- High
Prerequisite- Team work and timeline.
WATERFALL: is a most strictly followed model in software development process, in this pre-standardized result should be implement. You must finish each stage before starting a new one, so it is particularly good for projects with clearly defined objectives and defined expectations for each stage.
Methodology- Hands-off,begin by establish goals and expected outcomes
Flexibility- Low
Requirements- Submitting deliverables to move to the next phase

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
Requirement Engineering- This is analogous to preparing a blueprint (the requirements) before building a house. You see, it is all about talking to users and stakeholders, and figuring out what the software should be doing. It helps developers determine what to construct.
It is necessary for it makes sure that the software satisfies customers demands as well as assumptions. Tech neither a Problem Nor a Solution Without requirements any technology is a waste.
Software Design Principles- are maintenance manual for making your house strong. They assist developers in writing software that is human-readable, changeable, and refactorable. instance; modularity, encapculation, separation of concerns... These three principle which help the software to be flexible, scalable and robust.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity in software design is an approach where software is partitioned into smaller, standalone modules, such as functions, classes or components. Gives you the ability to manage it more easily and understanding of complex systems by breaking them down into digestable parts
Modularity improves maintainability and scalability of software by dividing it into distinct modules, developers can manage, update and scale parts of the application independently,leading to more efficient maintenance and easier scalability.(http://www.secoda,co)
Maintenance efficiency- isolating issues within specific modules simplifies debugging and updating processes.(http://www.secoda,co)
Scalability- Modular designs allow for addding,updating or scaling specific modules without impacting the entire system.(http://www.secoda,co)

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Software testing is crucial step for an engineering team to complete. NO matter what software or product created, bugs, glitches and errors will likely occur. But those errors become less of a headache when they are identified and solved early. I t ensures reliability, high performance, and security, saving time and money.

Unit testing- Validating that each software unit runs as expected. A unit is the smallest testable component of an application.
Integration testing- Ensuring that software components or functions operate together.
System testing- checks for a systemâ€™s compliance in accordance with the necessary given requirements
Acceptance testing- Verifying whether the whole system works intended.

Version Control Systems:
Version control systems are the most important tools in the development of software, those systems allow us to make changes, work collaboratively, and keep a history of a project. Comes with different kind of features to work on as per requirement where widely used are Git, SVN, Mercurial etc. All of this makes them indispensable in the world of software we live in today: they help teams work together and they give you backups and let you experiment .Important Concepts in Version Control Systems:
So you can do some collaboration, merge your changes together while working on the same project by two or more developers.
Developers can try to navigate a project without understanding how it evolved, but having a history of changes (and being able to see who made what changes, and why) can tremendously help.
Backup - Backup system. If your files are deleted or lost or accidentally modified, you can still get back the previous version of the desired file.
Experimentation- Allows you to create branches, where you can experiment with new features without affecting the main codebase. If the experiment works, you can merge it back; if not, you can discard it without any impact.

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Popular version systems and their features:
GIT-
Features: Distributed version control, branching and merging, lightweight and fast.
Pros: Works offline, highly flexible, widely used (e.g., by GitHub).
Cons: Can be complex for beginners.
Use Case: Ideal for both individual projects and large teams

Subversion-
Features: Centralized version control, supports branching and tagging, atomic commits.
Pros: Easier to learn for beginners, strong file management.
Cons: Requires a central server, not as flexible as Git.
Use Case: Suited for projects where a centralized model is preferred.

Mercurial-
Features: Distributed version control, similar to Git but with a simpler interface.
Pros: Easier to use than Git, handles large projects well.
Cons: Less popular than Git, fewer resources and integrations.
Use Case: Good for projects needing simplicity and performance.

Perforce-
Features: Centralized version control, supports large files, integrates with various development tools.
Pros: Handles large binary files well, robust performance.
Cons: More complex setup, can be expensive.
Use Case: Suitable for large enterprises and projects with large assets.

Software Project Management:
 Software Project Managementis defined as  being a niche technical skill set and more importantly a booming field, in these years. As the level of reliance on software continues to rise, more and more focus is being spent on getting projects out the door and into production as quick as possible, with as little bugs as possible.

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

The project manager in software role is responsible for leading a team of software developers to deliver working software projects on time, within budget and to the satisfaction of stakeholders. These are the people who plan, carry out, and finish projects. This includes identifying project scope, developing a schedule, assigning resources, controlling risks, and tracking progress.

The project manager also needs to keep stakeholders, including clients, management, and team members, informed, making sure everyone is on the same page.They must have strong leadership skills, be able to manage competing priorities, and have a deep understanding of software development methodologies and tools. Overall, the role of a project manager in software is critical to ensuring the success of software projects. A project manager in software is responsible for leading a team of software developers and ensuring that software projects are completed on time, within budget, and to the satisfaction of the stakeholders. They are responsible for planning, executing, and closing projects. This involves defining project scope, creating schedules, allocating resources, managing risks, and monitoring progress.(Project management.com 31/12/22023Hannah Donando)

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
